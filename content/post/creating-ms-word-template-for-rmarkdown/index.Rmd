writing report with RStudio made easier with rmarkdown. I prefer html output, however I still need to write reports in MS Word. 

however, the default formatting when knitting rmd file into docx was hideous. either that, or i just used to write report in ms word and worry about the formatting later. 

so i was reading about officedown package, and when i want to develop my own template, I end up to this page https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html . 

the page is quite old, so i decided to try reproduce it, and see if any of the instruction still relevant, or there are some of the instruction need to be updated.

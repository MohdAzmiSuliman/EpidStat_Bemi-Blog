add in use for citation

simplest way to add citation in rstudio is to use visual mode and choose insert (hotkey Ctrl+Shift+F8), however i try to avoid using visual mode - it seem buggy, and slow. 

but if you like me, who prefer source mode, you might want to try rbbt or citr.

unfortunately, citr addin was not available in cran, and have to install directly from github (using remotes::intall_github() function)

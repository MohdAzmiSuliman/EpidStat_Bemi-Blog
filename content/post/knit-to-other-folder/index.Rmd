Usually in single project, we will have less than 10 files.

so every file located in the same folder should not be problem.

but what if we have lots of files, and we want to have several subfolders?

saving plots to subfolder:

knit rmd file into subfolder:

```yaml
---
title: "title"
author: "gordon freeman"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"

knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
      out_dir <- "reports";
      rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                        encoding=encoding,
                        output_dir=file.path(dirname(inputFile), out_dir))})
---
```

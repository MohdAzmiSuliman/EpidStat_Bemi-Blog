<p>Usually in single project, we will have less than 10 files.</p>
<p>so every file located in the same folder should not be problem.</p>
<p>but what if we have lots of files, and we want to have several subfolders?</p>
<p>saving plots to subfolder:</p>
<p>knit rmd file into subfolder:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>---

knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
      out_dir &lt;- &quot;reports&quot;;
      rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                        encoding=encoding,
                        output_dir=file.path(dirname(inputFile), out_dir))})

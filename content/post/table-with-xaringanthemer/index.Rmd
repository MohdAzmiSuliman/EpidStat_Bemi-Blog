xaringanthemer package really help people who doesn't have knowledge on css.

unfortunately, xaringanthemer by default create table with alternate colour for row.

but if you want to make the table not to have alternate background colour for row, 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
style_mono_dark(table_row_even_background_color = apply_alpha("#cbf7ed", opacity = 0))
```
